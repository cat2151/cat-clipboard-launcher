# Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This refactoring applied the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to split the codebase into focused modules, with each file targeting around 100 lines. This improves maintainability and reduces hallucination risk.

## Module Structure

### Before Refactoring
- **launcher.py**: 485 lines (all functionality in one file)

### After Refactoring
The code has been split into 7 focused modules:

1. **launcher.py** (89 lines)
   - Main orchestrator
   - Coordinates the workflow between modules
   - Command-line argument parsing

2. **config.py** (62 lines)
   - Configuration file loading (TOML)
   - Configuration data access
   - Default value handling

3. **clipboard.py** (72 lines)
   - Clipboard read operations
   - Temporary file management
   - Output file to clipboard writing

4. **pattern_matcher.py** (176 lines)
   - Pattern matching logic
   - Regex matching operations
   - Line number tracking
   - Text colorization for matches
   - Display line selection

5. **tui.py** (63 lines)
   - Terminal User Interface display
   - Formatted output with ANSI colors
   - Pattern selection prompt

6. **executor.py** (35 lines)
   - Command execution
   - Placeholder replacement
   - Error handling for command execution

7. **input_handler.py** (36 lines)
   - User keyboard input
   - Key press handling
   - Selection validation

## Benefits

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify individual modules
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Smaller files reduce cognitive load
4. **Better Testability**: Isolated functions are easier to test
5. **Lower Hallucination Risk**: Smaller, focused modules reduce AI interpretation errors

## Testing

- All 66 existing tests pass
- Tests updated to import from new modules
- No functionality lost in refactoring
- Code formatting and linting verified

## Statistics

- **Before**: 485 lines in 1 file
- **After**: 534 lines across 7 files (89 + 62 + 72 + 176 + 63 + 35 + 36)
- **Main launcher reduced by**: 81.6% (485 â†’ 89 lines)
- **Largest new module**: pattern_matcher.py (176 lines) - still reasonable
- **Test coverage**: 66 tests, all passing
